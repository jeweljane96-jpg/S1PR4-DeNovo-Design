# S1PR4-DeNovo-Design
Fragment-based de novo molecular design targeting S1PR4 (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 4), an underexplored immunomodulatory GPCR. Generates novel, synthetically accessible scaffolds using RECAP fragmentation, pharmacophore constraints, and multi-objective scoring (QED, SA, PAINS). Built with RDKit &amp; ChEMBL.
